	 *  Encapsulation â€” "Hiding the internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.
	 *  
	 *  More used to protect data form outside and packing logic and data together. 
	 *  Usually more focus on centralizing code to do one thing and properly.
	 *  
	 *  Think it like a piece of code, which focus on same main field of action or core methods and same field of protected data.
	 *  
	 *  problem is solved at implementation level when abstraction at design level.
	 *  
	 *  /!\ Encapsulation is a process of binding data and methods together in a single unit, providing controlled access to data.
